# Automata Lab
Automata simulator designed to aid computer science education. 

Supported automata: Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA), and Pushdown Automata (PDA).

A GUI is provided to create, save/load (browser local storage), export/import (plaintext format), and debug finite state machines.

A large set of test strings can be designated to be accepted or rejected and then all tested at once.

Or, a specific string can be step-debugged to see exactly how the finite state machine would handle it.

You can embed a machine description in a URL hash and the page will load it for you.  This allows you to provide a link that will load a specific machine.  For example: `http://[site-domain]/#[paste machine description here]`
